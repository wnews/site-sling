  "abstract": "The long lock-down last year brought many challenges. We bring you: ‘Cate’s and Clem’s Covid Challenge’. \nOn 1 April, Cate started knitting little 6cm squares from colourful scrap wool, joining them together as she went, to make a cushion cover.  One-a-day, it took sixty-one days to complete each one, and over eight months she made four.  \nNot to be outdone, Clem resolved to learn to make scones.  Never much of a cook, his limit was the barbecue, and bacon and eggs breakfast for the grandkids when they came.\nScone Recipe 1. 92-year-old CWA veteran Muriel was his first inspiration. She had abandoned the standard CWA recipe and used the cream and lemonade method. (Watch her on YouTube).\n",

    "Add 300 ml of lemonade and mix to combine, but don’t overdo it.",

    "Place on a floured bench, fold a couple of times and form into a square about 4 cm thick. ",
    "Cut into smaller squares making 16 or 20 scones.  ",
    "Paint the top of each scone with milk.   \n",
    "Bake in the oven at 180ºc for 15 minutes on a tray, turning around half-way through (the tray, not him)."
