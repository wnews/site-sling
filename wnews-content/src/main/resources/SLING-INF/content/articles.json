        "On a warm and sunny Sunday (19 February 2017),  locals and visitors gathered in the gardens of the Waranga Hostel in Rushworth to help celebrate the hostel’s 20th birthday.",
        "The garden and the setting had been manicured and planned in fine detail to make everyone feel welcome and to put them in a party mood.",
        "Dignitaries were present to give the occasion some gravitas as Clem Furphy guided the occasion through its formalities. About 170 guests - including Steph Ryan Member for Euroa), Sharman Stone (who officially opened the hostel in 1997) and Doug Crow (at that time, the Chief Commissioner of the newly-formed Shire of Campaspe) who turned the first sod. Clem added to the historical touch of the day by bringing along the actual shovel used, but suitably rejuvenated for the occasion with a touch of gold paint!",
        "Also present were Campaspe Mayor, Adrian Weston, Noel Maughan (former Member for Rodney), John and Mark O’Mahoney (the builders), Trevor Saunders (CEO of GV Health) and Jane French (Manager/Director of Nursing of GV Health, Waranga Campus).",
        "<strong>A community celebration</strong>",
        "But the day belonged to the Hostel and its staff and residents - and the work and coordination of the Friends of the Hostel who had put so much time and effort into making the celebration the great success it was.",
        "Many thanks to all these people (including staff who volunteered their time on the day) who made the Garden Party such a successful community event.",
        "Hostel residents and their families, staff and local guests were treated to a plentiful afternoon tea,   followed by a barbecue later in the day - for anyone who could manage to eat anything more!",
        "Students of Rushworth P-12 College were the very capable and friendly waiting staff serving the tables and the Lions Club manned the sausage sizzle, the Rushworth Concert Band entertained the guests and Murray Ross sketched away in the background.",
        "It was good to acknowledge all those who had been part of the original idea, planning and fund-raising that made the Hostel a reality - and what a boost it’s been for our local area. It has enabled locals in need of care to stay local and to remain part of the community. Its location, right in the centre of Rushworth, means that residents are not cut-off from the town facilities and can always get a yarn if they are up to a walk down the street.",
        "The hostel has also been a boost for training and employment opportunities. Congratulations to all concerned who have all contributed to this great asset for the local community."

        "Our own Dr Mary Jo Fortuna of Rushworth has been awarded an Order of Australia Medal in the latest Queen’s Birthday honours list.",
        "The closely guarded news was kept amazingly ‘secret’ and embargoed, but with the publishing of the honours list last Monday, the news spread like wildfire, with the Waranga News Editor beseiged by phone calls at the News office and filming interviews for WIN news television screening.",
        "Anyone who’s known Mary Jo will appreciate the service she has given the various local and university campuses over the years. But few would know her full involvement until the reading of the citation was published, and there are probably many other services that have not made it to the list!",
        "Need we note that Mary Jo, herself, was quite overwhelmed by the attention and commented that she had nearly forgotten some of her various involvements.",
        "<strong>Retirement ~ not exactly!</strong>",
        "Although Mary Jo retired from lecturing and co-ordinating the Social Science faculty at the Shepparton Campus of La Trobe University in 2014, her days of pottering in the garden (as she had envisaged) have not exactly come to fruition. She was head-hunted to work with the St Vincent de Paul Society as Social Justice coordinator for the NorthEast Central region which often takes her off to Shepparton or Melbourne for meetings (just when we need her here), and her work in St Mary’s Parish includes playing music and being a member of the Parish Pastoral Council.",
        "As well as all this, involvement in her large family’s events and celebrations make many calls on her - well, with her seven children now married and twelve grandchildren, there are always reasons to gather!"

        "Rushworth residents with long memories will know it’s been a long time coming, but construction of the local rail trail appears to be one step closer to becoming a reality. Now known as the Waranga Trail, the signing of land management agreements has been endorsed by Campaspe Shire Council so that external funding negotiations can go ahead.",
        "Campaspe Mayor, Cr Leigh Wilson, said Council’s endorsement of the project would facilitate negotiations with grant bodies and partner organisations to secure funding to deliver the project some time in the future.",
        "“The Waranga Trail has been a subject of consideration by the local community and Council for over ten years,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "Over the past six months, Council has undertaken feasibility studies and cost/benefit analyses to assess the viability of the trail project. This information can now form the basis of a business case which will position the project as an attractive funding proposition.",
        "The proposed Waranga Trail includes the rail trail from Murchison to Rushworth and a connecting trail through to Heathcote. Scoping and estimates for the section of the trail, from Rushworth eastwards to the shire boundary towards Murchison and the section from Heathcote to Rushworth, have now been completed.",
        "Discussions and negotiations have been held with VicTrack, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Goulburn Murray Water, Parks Victoria, City of Greater Bendigo and private land holders. Consultation has also included Regional Development Victoria to affirm the potential viability of securing funding support.",
        "“Based on these consultations, we have concluded that construction of both reaches of the trail is feasible and will generate a positive return on investment,” the Mayor said.",
        "An interim costing predicts the Rushworth to Murchison link will cost approximately $1.2 million and the Heathcote to Rushworth link will cost approximately $1.1 million.",
        "The Waranga Trail is identified as a key Shire of Campaspe project in the Regional Development Australia prospectus. Council officers have undertaken more detailed work seeking to secure access rights to the trail route to eliminate risks and issues should the project be funded.",
        "“Council’s endorsement of the project and signing of agreements with VicTrack and Goulburn Murray Water to secure tenure of land will demonstrate our full commitment to potential external funding bodies,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "However it’s not all in the bag yet. External grant opportunities are likely to require Council to match any funding contribution dollar for dollar. Council says it is committed to negotiating with stakeholders and partners to a point where the project is ready to go should the funding become available.",
        "While the project does not extend to a trail linking Girgarre to Rushworth at present, Council acknowledges this would have the capacity to generate positive health and wellbeing outcomes for local residents.",
        "Council officers will continue to facilitate negotiations to allow the Girgarre Development Committee to assume management of DELWP land between Girgarre and Stanhope to extend the existing small community-owned trail."

Trees were up-rooted or had large parts of their canopies snapped off, and intense downpours occurred over some areas while others escaped virtually unscathed. These photos by Cass Alexander show the storm in action and some of its aftermath.",
        "Rushworth Observatory recorded 30mm of rain in a five minute deluge that quickly left the domed telescope housing surrounded by water. Huge rain drops pelted down, as seen in the photo at right.",
        "Trees toppled near Murchison, and the RushworthTatura Road was blocked by foliage dislodged from roadside trees (above). One tree on Chief Perry’s property was uprooted completely by the fierce winds (below).",
        "Members of Rushworth Fire Brigade quickly initiated a cleanup operation, and were soon assisted by a front-end loader and driver from a nearby construction crew, and a local motorist who arrived with a chainsaw (lower right).",
        "A VicRoads crew also arrived on scene, and the cleared road was finally given a final wash-down by the tanker’s powerful front monitor. The highway was reopened within a half hour, and traffic was soon moving once again",
        "It was a great team effort by all of those involved."

Mr Holschier stated, “We were very encouraged with putting forward Andrew’s nomination, when we received so many supporting letters from the various organisations Andrew was involved with, that brought so much recognition Australia - wide to Stanhope”. These supporting letters came from Dairy Australia, Fonterra, AFL, Murray Goulburn region, the Stanhope Primary School and parents of children involved with Auskick."
