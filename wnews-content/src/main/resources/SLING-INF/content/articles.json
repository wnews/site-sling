      "pars": [
        "Our own Dr Mary Jo Fortuna of Rushworth has been awarded an Order of Australia Medal in the latest Queen’s Birthday honours list.",
        "The closely guarded news was kept amazingly ‘secret’ and embargoed, but with the publishing of the honours list last Monday, the news spread like wildfire, with the Waranga News Editor beseiged by phone calls at the News office and filming interviews for WIN news television screening.",
        "Anyone who’s known Mary Jo will appreciate the service she has given the various local and university campuses over the years. But few would know her full involvement until the reading of the citation was published, and there are probably many other services that have not made it to the list!",
        "Need we note that Mary Jo, herself, was quite overwhelmed by the attention and commented that she had nearly forgotten some of her various involvements.",
        "<strong>Retirement ~ not exactly!</strong>",
        "Although Mary Jo retired from lecturing and co-ordinating the Social Science faculty at the Shepparton Campus of La Trobe University in 2014, her days of pottering in the garden (as she had envisaged) have not exactly come to fruition. She was head-hunted to work with the St Vincent de Paul Society as Social Justice coordinator for the NorthEast Central region which often takes her off to Shepparton or Melbourne for meetings (just when we need her here), and her work in St Mary’s Parish includes playing music and being a member of the Parish Pastoral Council.",
        "As well as all this, involvement in her large family’s events and celebrations make many calls on her - well, with her seven children now married and twelve grandchildren, there are always reasons to gather!"

      "title": "Waranga Trail - a small step closer",
      "pars": [
        "Rushworth residents with long memories will know it’s been a long time coming, but construction of the local rail trail appears to be one step closer to becoming a reality. Now known as the Waranga Trail, the signing of land management agreements has been endorsed by Campaspe Shire Council so that external funding negotiations can go ahead.",
        "Campaspe Mayor, Cr Leigh Wilson, said Council’s endorsement of the project would facilitate negotiations with grant bodies and partner organisations to secure funding to deliver the project some time in the future.",
        "“The Waranga Trail has been a subject of consideration by the local community and Council for over ten years,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "Over the past six months, Council has undertaken feasibility studies and cost/benefit analyses to assess the viability of the trail project. This information can now form the basis of a business case which will position the project as an attractive funding proposition.",
        "The proposed Waranga Trail includes the rail trail from Murchison to Rushworth and a connecting trail through to Heathcote. Scoping and estimates for the section of the trail, from Rushworth eastwards to the shire boundary towards Murchison and the section from Heathcote to Rushworth, have now been completed.",
        "Discussions and negotiations have been held with VicTrack, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Goulburn Murray Water, Parks Victoria, City of Greater Bendigo and private land holders. Consultation has also included Regional Development Victoria to affirm the potential viability of securing funding support.",
        "“Based on these consultations, we have concluded that construction of both reaches of the trail is feasible and will generate a positive return on investment,” the Mayor said.",
        "An interim costing predicts the Rushworth to Murchison link will cost approximately $1.2 million and the Heathcote to Rushworth link will cost approximately $1.1 million.",
        "The Waranga Trail is identified as a key Shire of Campaspe project in the Regional Development Australia prospectus. Council officers have undertaken more detailed work seeking to secure access rights to the trail route to eliminate risks and issues should the project be funded.",
        "“Council’s endorsement of the project and signing of agreements with VicTrack and Goulburn Murray Water to secure tenure of land will demonstrate our full commitment to potential external funding bodies,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "However it’s not all in the bag yet. External grant opportunities are likely to require Council to match any funding contribution dollar for dollar. Council says it is committed to negotiating with stakeholders and partners to a point where the project is ready to go should the funding become available.",
        "While the project does not extend to a trail linking Girgarre to Rushworth at present, Council acknowledges this would have the capacity to generate positive health and wellbeing outcomes for local residents.",
        "Council officers will continue to facilitate negotiations to allow the Girgarre Development Committee to assume management of DELWP land between Girgarre and Stanhope to extend the existing small community-owned trail."

An avid reader, Mavis always enjoys getting her Waranga News to catch up with the local events.

      "pars": [
        "When ferocious winds and torrential rain impacted parts of Rushworth last week, it left some areas of the district looking like a war zone. Trees were up-rooted or had large parts of their canopies snapped off, and intense downpours occurred over some areas while others escaped virtually unscathed. These photos by Cass Alexander show the storm in action and some of its aftermath.",
        "Rushworth Observatory recorded 30mm of rain in a five minute deluge that quickly left the domed telescope housing surrounded by water. Huge rain drops pelted down, as seen in the photo at right.",
        "Trees toppled near Murchison, and the RushworthTatura Road was blocked by foliage dislodged from roadside trees (above). One tree on Chief Perry’s property was uprooted completely by the fierce winds (below).",
        "Members of Rushworth Fire Brigade quickly initiated a cleanup operation, and were soon assisted by a front-end loader and driver from a nearby construction crew, and a local motorist who arrived with a chainsaw (lower right).",
        "A VicRoads crew also arrived on scene, and the cleared road was finally given a final wash-down by the tanker’s powerful front monitor. The highway was reopened within a half hour, and traffic was soon moving once again",
        "It was a great team effort by all of those involved."
