        "St Mary’s School students commemorated National Sorry Day on Friday 26 May. The event was first held in Sydney in 1998 and is now commemorated nationally to remember and honour the Stolen Generations. The day commenced with a prayer ceremony in the morning after which each student decorated and laid a ‘foot’ beneath the school’s flags. The colours of the feet are linked with the colours of the Australian, the Aboriginal and the Torres Straight Islander flags. The feet represent St Mary’s commitment to working together with Aboriginal Australians for reconciliation and justice."

        "Linking Rushworth to a network of Victorian rail trails is something that some may only think is a dream, yet such could start to happen sooner, rather being just a dream! With the popular O’Keefe Rail Trail now extended and connecting Heathcote, Axedale and Bendigo, bringing tourists to those areas, could Rushworth also be on the radar for those same trail walkers and cyclists?",
        "On Wednesday 17 May, eight members of the Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore Rail Trail group rode into Rushworth from Heathcote. Why? Were they lost? What was to be achieved?",
        "No they were not lost, and yes they wanted to be in Rushworth! Yes, they did spend money in both Heathcote and Rushworth, and yes they enjoyed looking at places of interest along High Street, Rushworth and the former railway reserve. One cycling member and his wife plus caravan were even staying overnight at Rushworth.",
        "The real reason for the ride was to explore and assess ‘on-the-ground’, a possible cycling route between Heathcote and Rushworth, away from rural roads and traf c where possible.",
        "A route that was both interesting and safe, for the type of people who enjoy visiting rail trails.",
        "The selected route for the investigation was mostly utilising forest tracks within the Heathcote-Graytown National Park and the Whroo Nature Conservation Reserve, yet some rural roads did have to be included.",
        "With the Murchison-Rushworth (Waranga) Rail Trail having its section within the Greater Shepparton Council area completed, many trail cycling and walking tourists are waiting for the remaining section into Rushworth to be completed by the Campaspe Shire.",
        "When the trail is continuous, it will be a large boost for tourism in the area, plus being used by the local community. Maximising this trail’s potential would bene t hugely from also being connected to other such trails, like the O’Keefe Rail Trail.",
        "A funded feasibility study is currently investigating the potential and possibility of a proposed Wallan to Heathcote Rail Trail (65kms). Such a trail would directly connect to the O’Keefe Rail Trail (50kms) at Heathcote, a combined 115kms trail. The study’s consultants are also investigating the possibility of linking such a trail into the Melbourne Metro trail network, as well as the Great Victorian Rail Trail. This possibility has huge potential for Victorian regional cycle and walking tourism, the creation of a network of linked trails. The study’s  nal report is expected to be published by July of this year.",
        "In the meantime, Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore Rail Trail members who rode the 50kms on Wednesday were impressed by their chosen route, as well as the points of interest noted along the ride.",

        "Earl was found on the ground at a farmland property at Earlston. There was no mother koala in sight, but in a nearby tree an adult male was spotted.",
        "Although it is outside the main breeding time for koalas in our area they can also mate during this time, so there is always the possibility that little Earl was separated from his mother in an altercation between her and a male. Like many of our patients here at Bohollow, we will never know his full story as to how he ran into trouble and ended up alone on the ground, but he has likely been without his mother for more than just one day as he is under-weight.",
        "Deb picked him up from our Bunbartha shelter shortly after I arrived home with him and he has already perked up considerably with regular feeds and care. He will be raised by Deb at our Kotupna shelter and eventually go on to be released if all goes well.",
        "Female koalas usually begin to breed around three or four years of age and can have one offspring each year, although sometimes they may only produce young once every two or three years. This can depend on food sources, habitat and the age of the female. Females average a lifespan in the wild of around twelve years and during their life they may only have  ve or six young.",
        "From conception to the birth of a koala joey, it only takes 35 days! Newborn koalas are teeny, only weighing in at about a gram and measuring around 2cm long. Just like other marsupial joeys, they are akin to a hairless, pink, blind jelly bean and they make the same arduous journey from the birth canal to their mother’s pouch without any help. To do this, they rely on their sense of smell and touch, using their already strong forelimbs and claws to make the climb. Upon reaching the safety of the pouch, the koala joey attaches itself to one of two teats. The teat swells to  ll its tiny mouth which helps to prevent the babe from detaching and mother koala contracts muscles at the top of her pouch to keep her young safe and free from the danger of falling out.",
        "For six to seven months, the koala joey remains in the pouch, only drinks its mother’s milk and develops eyes, ears and fur. When they are around twenty-two weeks old, they begin to take peeks out of the pouch with freshly opened eyes.",
        "Koala mothers also produce a substance other than milk which is called pap. Pap has a soft, runny consistency and is actually made of faeces (droppings) and this is a vital part of the joey’s diet from around twenty-two to thirty weeks. Pap contains the micro- organisms in the mother’s digestive system and is rich in protein which, through digesting the pap, is passed onto the joey. This allows the transition from milk to eucalyptus leaves, as these important micro-organisms enable the koala to digest them. To feed on pap, the joey must lean out of the pouch. Pap becomes a regular part of their diet until they begin to feed on fresh leaves, usually feeding on these while on their mother’s back. When a koala joey is too big to  t inside the pouch, the mother’s teat becomes very elongated so it protrudes from the pouch to make feeding easier. A baby koala will continue to drink milk from their mother until they are a year old and remain with their mother until the next joey appears from the pouch. Therefore if a female does not have another joey the following year, her joey will often remain with her longer and has a greater chance of survival.",
        "Koalas truly are one of Australia’s unique critters!"

        "Rushworth Court House is re-awakening. Waranga News of 30 March reported on plans to remove bats and white ants, and to appoint local management. Now the imposing old building, built in 1877, is featured in a new book by local historian and News writer Alan McLean, titled “Order in the Court!”",
        "The book shows the Court House has witnessed an extraordinary passing parade, some arriving on foot, others tying a horse to a nearby rail or tree. The building welcomed “an able-bodied specimen of the loa ng fraternity”. Another defendant challenged the nasal senses, being “as shy of water as he was of work”. More than one went up for endangering lives by “furious riding”.",
        "In 1887, after 18 years as a Justice of the Peace, Wolton Wigg, a local brewer, was called into the dock, not to his preferred seat on the Bench. Found in a boat with a gun and a bag of dead game birds, he strangely pleaded “not guilty”! The good J.P. was convicted and  ned for shooting ducks out of season. His career on the Bench continued but his days hearing poaching charges were over.",

        "Even before that original building was constructed and within six months of the discovery of gold in 1853, two visitors to the local diggings went straight to Melbourne’s Supreme Court where they were convicted of separate crimes at Moora and Rushworth. Both were hanged in Melbourne Gaol.",
        "In 1857, three men went down for “highway robbery” near Rushworth’s Criterion Hotel. The Moora hotels, the Wanalta hotel and several hotels at Whroo also had their share of unwanted action. In a major shock, the book  nds that some pubs traded outside legal hours!",

All passed through the Court House door, each earning a place in the book.",

They were heading off on the inaugural Sacred Earth Yoga Tour to India, a tour organised by Sue Barlow of the Mud Hut Yoga Studio, Rushworth. The idea was to create an opportunity to experience the wonders of India (the birth place of yoga) and at the same time to experience yoga in quite a different way from attending a regular class at a studio.",

From the moment of exiting the airport, India was everything one might have expected - and then add some! Immediately all of the senses are engaged in experiencing the land and its culture. The visual explosion of colourful saris, ceremonial  owers and sparkly ‘jewel’ encrusted wares, the cacophony of endless beeping horns in chaotic traf c of cars and rickshaws, the smells of incense and spice (and some of not so pleasant origin), the teeming pedestrian population of people old and young, of street vendors, of animals - sometimes camels and donkeys, but always, always COWS.",

It was a Sunday when we visited – and they were all there – the whole 1.25 billion – well, not really, but it felt like that for those of us used to space and a lot less people!",

The Fort was lit up against the night sky and the music was so very beautiful it is impossible to do justice by way of explanation. After this we travelled to Varanasi. This city is considered very holy and many pilgrims come to Varanasi to bathe in the Ganges River. It is considered auspicious to die and be cremated in Varanasi. This extremely busy and fascinating city is undergoing many changes at present, which will hopefully make life easier for the residents. This is only a brief snapshot of all the things we saw and experienced.",
        "Throughout our tour, we had regular yoga classes which were designed to either prepare us for the day ahead or relax us and calm us for a good night’s sleep. We also attended a Laughter Yoga class in a park in Jaipur which was a lot of fun. Ridiculous really – but a lot of fun!! We also attended a community sunrise yoga class down by the Ganges while in Varanasi. The food and accommodation was excellent throughout. Our Indian guide, Amit, went out of his way to ensure we were informed, comfortable and enjoying ourselves. And, being a yogi himself, he even had us doing yoga on the bus some days. We walked, we talked, we ate, we laughed, we saw amazing sights and we all came home with a great appreciation for India.",
        "In many ways, the highlight of the trip was the fantastic group of people. Everyone had a great time and we all enjoyed one another’s company."

        "A much loved and highly respected resident of Rushworth, Doris Barlow was farewelled at St Paul’s Anglican Church and at a graveside ceremony at the Rushworth Lawn Cemetery, both of which were conducted by Fr. André Du Plooy, on the afternoon of Friday 3 March.",
        "The esteem in which Doris was held was evident by the large number in attendance, with St Paul’s Church packed.",
        "Among the family present were Doris’s sisters, Enid and Marion, and the family of her other sister, Jean, who was not well enough to attend. Also there were Doris’s daughter, Heather, and sons Ross, Colin and Neil, together with members of her extended family.",
        "The tribute to Doris was presented by her son, Colin, on behalf of the family and forms the basis of the following information.",
        "<strong>The early years</strong>",
        "Doris was born in Natimuk on 23 October 1925 to James Palmer and his wife Ida (nee Pfennig). Three sisters followed: Jean, Enid and Marion. Her mother, known as Edie, died of pneumonia in Woodend at age 35, two months after Marion’s birth.",
        "Doris attended Kyneton High School, and then went to Melbourne Teachers College, whilst living with her family who had transferred to Essendon.",
        "<strong>The teacher</strong>",
        "Doris first taught at an upper elementary school in the northern suburbs of Melbourne for a year, Yarram Upper Elementary for a year, then transferred to Rushworth.",
        "<strong>Family life</strong>",
        "It was at Rushworth that Doris met and married Robert Henry (Bob) Barlow, a third generation farmer. The wedding was in Essendon, and then Doris took on the duties of housewife, retiring from teaching after the initial eighteen months at Rushworth.",
        "They lived on the family farm ‘Moorakyne’, speaking often of the candle and kerosene lighting days and irregular water supply, depending on the temperamental windmill on the Nine Mile Creek.",
        "Bob and Doris had four children: Heather, Ross, Colin and Neil. She was thrilled by the arrival of Heather’s children (Narelle and David), Ross’s children (Alexandra and Andrew) and Colin’s children (Christopher, Matthew and Catherine), and loved knitting baby clothes as each new baby arrived. There are now six great grandchildren.",
        "The friendship and support of neighbours were very much appreciated and Bob and Doris had a lot of fun playing tennis at Wanalta, and golf at Rushworth and further a field.",
        "<strong>The move into Rushworth</strong>",
        "The dif culty of providing water and the absence of power on the farm led to Bob and Doris building a new solid brick house called ‘Wyeera’ in Moora Road, about the time Ross was born. This was the family home and continued to be Doris’s residence until frailty forced her into the Waranga Aged Care Hostel and then the Nursing Home.",
        "Both Bob and Doris continued playing tennis and golf after shifting into Rushworth, until well into their sixties, and in the later years took up bowls as well. Many longstanding friendships that continued for the rest of their lives were initiated on the sporting  elds. Doris loved playing golf, not only at Rushworth, but also at Tatura and other surrounding clubs.",
        "<strong>Love of travel</strong>",
        "Doris travelled extensively in Australia, including the Canning Stock Route, Rabbit Flat, Ayers Rock and all the capital cities.",
        "She also regularly ventured overseas to Europe, Asia, New Zealand and many other places.",
        "<strong>Community involvement</strong>",
        "Doris was involved in many community organisations over the years, including: The Council of Adult Education; Probus; The ‘buddy program’ at the school; Secretary of the Rushworth CAG (the Shire of Campaspe Advisory Group after the amalgamation of the shires); Neighbourhood Watch; Rushworth Senior Citizens; School and sporting club committees; The Waranga News.",
        "<strong>Thank you</strong>",
        "Colin concluded his address by saying, “On behalf of the family, I would like to sincerely thank the staff at the Waranga Aged Care Hostel and more recently the Nursing Home for the wonderful way they cared for Mum, and I must also thank Judy Ogden, Laurel Goggin, Nan Jessup and the many others who regularly visited and supported her whilst in care. Mum never failed to mention every time I visited her how lucky she was to be so well cared for at the Nursing Home.”",
        "<strong>A life well lived</strong>",
        "Doris’s life was certainly well lived. As Colin said in the eulogy, the family thought her life was best described in the words of the Frank Sinatra song, ‘I Did It My Way’."

Luckily horses and their slaves, plus dog, are very tough characters! After several feeds and sleeps they were all back on track again! Some of you may remember seeing them last year, the big coach with the two huge grey shire horses in the shafts both in the street parade on Saturday and working round at Moora on Sunday.",

Plus, a line-up of different working displays. I’m excited because our own stationary baler has been set in order and working again. It was owned and used by the late Max Seamer who was the driving force behind our Working Draught Horse Muster and our founding member.",

We are rapt to be able to have once again one of her framed works as  rst prize in our raf e. Last year’s picture was Rick’s big team and I am looking forward to seeing who will star in this year’s prize.",

There is also potential to complement tours of the forest with the latest technological applications for the more cyber-savvy users who want an informative exploration of Rushworth’s local forest without carrying a paper map!",

The school children were all dressed in period costume, appropriately setting the scene for celebrating 100 years of education in Colbinabbin.",

        "Principal, Robyn MacLean, thanked all those who had worked to prepare the school for the special celebrations. Wendy Morgan, who has taught at the school for many years, then cut the cake depicting a ‘100’ as the crowd gave three cheers for the future of the Colbinabbin Primary School. Those gathered then enjoyed a delicious morning tea prepared by the Colbinabbin parents and coordinated by Centenary Celebrations working group member, Robyn Ryan.",

        "A recent public outcry about the state government’s <a href=http://www.wnews.org.au/articles/list/carnage-in-state-forest.html>track-blocking policy</a> has urged a number of state MP’s and local government representatives, to visit the now famous ‘Telstra Trail’.",
        "Social media attention for the ‘Telstra Track’ near Rushworth has brought the standard practice of track- blocking into scrutiny as thousands of comments are recorded from across the nation complaining that public land is becoming increasingly inaccessible.",
        "Last week staff from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, admitted they were responsible for the widely condemned action of felling track-adjacent trees along seven kilometres of the popular ‘Telstra Trail’ in the Redcastle-Graytown State Forest, near Rushworth. They say this was done to deter trail- bike access and allow the track to regenerate after increased off-road use. Spokesperson, Paul Bates, is quoted saying around one hundred trees were felled across the track; however, a survey conducted by a local resident has recorded one hundred and ninety-three live trees have been destroyed. Over one hundred dead trees and branches have also been dragged across the forest  oor to create obstacles. It was noted that a large machine was used to move and push many of the trees over and that this machinery caused signi cant and widespread damage to countless native understory  ora species.",
        "The vox pop on social media shows that the community is unhappy not only about the environmental damage and access restriction, but also because there was no public consultation. Residents claim that prior to the Department’s actions the track was in good condition with minimal damage. It is described as a good, all-purpose track for walking and cycling on. The department spokesperson stated that walkers and cyclists may continue to use the track but it is evident that the new obstructions present great dif culty and danger to current legal users and that trail-bike riders will now just ride around the felled trees and cause further damage to the environment. A trail-bike rider on social media claimed that the obstacles will just make the track more of a challenge. It is interesting to note that not until after the works were complete, were signs erected advising users of restricted access. The attempt to prevent illegal use of the area has also encouraged the illegal collection of  rewood, with people already removing the fallen trees.",
        "The clear message that has been voiced to the environment minister by a number of state MPs in parliament is that forests should be able to be appropriately used by the public, but environmental concerns, including forest conservation and protection of ecosystems, must also be addressed.",
        "The department has acknowledged that in hindsight it should have done things differently, but unfortunately there is no way to turn back time. Instead the minister must look into the situation and create safeguards to protect the environment from future similar actions as well as to allow the public fair access and ongoing use."

She was head-hunted to work with the St Vincent de Paul Society as Social Justice coordinator for the NorthEast Central region which often takes her off to Shepparton or Melbourne for meetings (just when we need her here), and her work in St Mary’s Parish includes playing music and being a member of the Parish Pastoral Council.",

Now known as the Waranga Trail, the signing of land management agreements has been endorsed by Campaspe Shire Council so that external funding negotiations can go ahead.",
        "Campaspe Mayor, Cr Leigh Wilson, said Council’s endorsement of the project would facilitate negotiations with grant bodies and partner organisations to secure funding to deliver the project some time in the future.",
        "“The Waranga Trail has been a subject of consideration by the local community and Council for over ten years,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "Over the past six months, Council has undertaken feasibility studies and cost/benefit analyses to assess the viability of the trail project. This information can now form the basis of a business case which will position the project as an attractive funding proposition.",
        "The proposed Waranga Trail includes the rail trail from Murchison to Rushworth and a connecting trail through to Heathcote. Scoping and estimates for the section of the trail, from Rushworth eastwards to the shire boundary towards Murchison and the section from Heathcote to Rushworth, have now been completed.",
        "Discussions and negotiations have been held with VicTrack, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Goulburn Murray Water, Parks Victoria, City of Greater Bendigo and private land holders. Consultation has also included Regional Development Victoria to affirm the potential viability of securing funding support.",
        "“Based on these consultations, we have concluded that construction of both reaches of the trail is feasible and will generate a positive return on investment,” the Mayor said.",
        "An interim costing predicts the Rushworth to Murchison link will cost approximately $1.2 million and the Heathcote to Rushworth link will cost approximately $1.1 million.",
        "The Waranga Trail is identified as a key Shire of Campaspe project in the Regional Development Australia prospectus. Council officers have undertaken more detailed work seeking to secure access rights to the trail route to eliminate risks and issues should the project be funded.",
        "“Council’s endorsement of the project and signing of agreements with VicTrack and Goulburn Murray Water to secure tenure of land will demonstrate our full commitment to potential external funding bodies,” Cr Wilson said.",
        "However it’s not all in the bag yet. External grant opportunities are likely to require Council to match any funding contribution dollar for dollar. Council says it is committed to negotiating with stakeholders and partners to a point where the project is ready to go should the funding become available.",
        "While the project does not extend to a trail linking Girgarre to Rushworth at present, Council acknowledges this would have the capacity to generate positive health and wellbeing outcomes for local residents.",
        "Council officers will continue to facilitate negotiations to allow the Girgarre Development Committee to assume management of DELWP land between Girgarre and Stanhope to extend the existing small community-owned trail."
