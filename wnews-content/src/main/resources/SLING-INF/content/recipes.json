        "I don’t know why I’m in a cake making mode at the moment (because I’m not a baker by anyone’s standards), but I had sour cream in the fridge and no plans for it, when I remembered a quite delicious sour cream lemon cake that was served in a cafe in Williamstown some years ago. (I managed to wheedle the recipe from she who baked there)."

        "The cake was always served as muffins in Williamstown when I happened upon them - still piping hot from the oven. Oh deliciousness! With a cup of cappucino . . ."
